## Privacy Policy (English)

**Context Search Pro – Privacy Policy**  
Last updated: **YYYY-MM-DD**

Context Search Pro (“the extension”) respects your privacy and handles data as follows.

### 1. Data Collected
- The extension **does not collect or transmit personal data** to external servers.  
- The text you select on a page is inserted into your configured search URL **at the `{q}` placeholder** and **used solely to open search results**.  
- Your settings (custom engines, names, enabled flags, popup delay and max buttons) are stored in **Chrome Sync Storage (`chrome.storage.sync`)** and may sync across your devices if Chrome sync is enabled.

### 2. Single Purpose of Use
- Any data handled by the extension is used **only for one purpose**: **opening the selected text on the configured search destination**.  
- Data is **not** used for advertising, profiling, analytics, or tracking.

### 3. Data Sharing & Sale
- We **do not sell or share** data with third parties.  
- No analytics or advertising SDKs are embedded.

### 4. Permissions and Why We Use Them
- `contextMenus`: to show the “search selected text” item in the right-click menu.  
- `scripting`: to render a lightweight **mini popup UI** near the selection (no page scraping).  
- `tabs`: to open the search results in a **new tab**.  
- **Host permissions**: to run a minimal content script required to display the popup.  
  All permissions are used **solely for this single purpose**.

### 5. Data Retention
- Settings remain until you delete them or uninstall the extension.

### 6. User Controls
- You can edit or remove settings on the options page at any time.  
- Removing the extension deletes its stored settings from the browser.

### 7. Contact
- For questions, contact **your-email@example.com**.

### 8. Changes to This Policy
- We may update this policy as needed. Material changes will be announced in this repository.
