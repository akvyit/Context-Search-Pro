Context Search Pro – Privacy Policy
Last updated: 2025-11-21

Context Search Pro (“the extension”) respects your privacy and handles data as follows.

1. Data Collected
The extension does not collect or transmit personal data to external servers.
The text you select on a page is inserted into your configured search URL at the {q} placeholder and used solely to open search results.
Your settings (custom engines, names, enabled flags, popup delay and max buttons) are stored in Chrome Sync Storage (chrome.storage.sync) and may sync across your devices if Chrome sync is enabled.
2. Single Purpose of Use
Any data handled by the extension is used only for one purpose: opening the selected text on the configured search destination.
Data is not used for advertising, profiling, analytics, or tracking.
3. Data Sharing & Sale
We do not sell or share data with third parties.
No analytics or advertising SDKs are embedded.
4. Permissions and Why We Use Them
contextMenus: to show the “search selected text” item in the right-click menu.
scripting: to render a lightweight mini popup UI near the selection (no page scraping).
tabs: to open the search results in a new tab.
Host permissions: to run a minimal content script required to display the popup.
All permissions are used solely for this single purpose.
5. Data Retention
Settings remain until you delete them or uninstall the extension.
6. User Controls
You can edit or remove settings on the options page at any time.
Removing the extension deletes its stored settings from the browser.
7. Contact

8. Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy as needed. Material changes will be announced in this repository.
